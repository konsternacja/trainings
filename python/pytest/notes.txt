pytest test/name_of_test.py

pytest -s -> only then sth is printed

@pytest.fixture is for functions (one object that can be used in a multiple functions)

conftest.py - global fixtures

@pytest.mark.slow -> this is slow test!
pytest -m slow (we skip slow tests)

@pytest.mark.skip(reason='') -> this test won't be done

@pytest.mark.xfail -> we know this is gonna fail

example: 4 passed, 1 skipped, 1 xfailed

@pytest.mark.parametrize("side_length, expected_area", [(5, 25), (4,16), (9,81)])
^ few assertions at a time

mocking = isolating
